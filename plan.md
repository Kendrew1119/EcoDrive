# EcoDrive+ Champion Build Plan
## Drive Green. Earn Green. Grow Green.

EcoDrive+ is a live EV sustainability platform that turns driving behaviour into visible climate impact. The final demo combines a polished web dashboard with an ESP32 C++ hardware prototype, so judges can see sensor data move from a physical device into real-time carbon savings, route advice, rewards, and a gamified green city.

This plan assumes enough time and resources to build a complete demo-ready codebase while still keeping the pitch believable for the MBOT Fuel Not Found Hackathon 2026.

---

## 1. Winning Position

Most EV dashboard ideas stop at displaying numbers. EcoDrive+ is designed as a behaviour-change system:

1. **Sense** driving behaviour with ESP32, MPU6050, GPS, LEDs, OLED, and buzzer.
2. **Score** eco-driving locally with transparent formulas that judges can understand.
3. **Explain** the impact through real-time carbon savings and route energy estimates.
4. **Reward** better driving with EcoCoins, city growth, streaks, and achievements.
5. **Scale** from one driver to campus fleets, community challenges, and urban planning insights.

The core pitch line:

> EcoDrive+ does not only tell drivers they saved carbon. It lets them see it, feel it, prove it, and build something with it.

## 2. Judging Criteria Strategy

| Criteria | Marks | EcoDrive+ Strategy |
|---|---:|---|
| Problem Definition & Understanding | 15 | Frame the problem as a visibility and behaviour feedback gap in EV usage, not merely a missing dashboard feature. |
| Creativity & Innovation | 20 | Combine sensor feedback, carbon accounting, route energy simulation, city-building gamification, and community carbon goals. |
| Technical Execution | 25 | Show a working ESP32 C++ prototype streaming to a live website with WebSocket/MQTT-style data, formulas, and dashboard updates. |
| Presentation & Communication | 20 | Use a structured demo: calm driving, harsh acceleration, hard braking, route choice, city reward, leaderboard movement. |
| Sustainability & Impact | 20 | Translate every trip into kg CO2 saved, kWh avoided, money saved, and campus-wide reduction potential. |

## 6. ESP32 Firmware Plan

### 6.1 Hardware Components

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| ESP32 | Main controller and WiFi communication. |
| MPU6050 | Detect acceleration, harsh braking, sharp turning, and vibration. |
| NEO-6M GPS | Track speed, distance, and route position when signal is available. |
| SSD1306 OLED | Show live eco-score and warnings. |
| WS2812B LED strip | Ambient colour feedback: green, yellow, orange, red. |
| Buzzer | Short warning tones for harsh events. |
| Push button | Switch between live sensor, indoor simulator, and judge-interactive mode. |

### 6.2 C++ Module Design

```text
/firmware
  src/
    main.cpp
    sensors/Mpu6050Reader.cpp
    sensors/GpsReader.cpp
    scoring/EcoScore.cpp
    feedback/OledView.cpp
    feedback/LedFeedback.cpp
    feedback/BuzzerFeedback.cpp
    network/TelemetryClient.cpp
    demo/DemoMode.cpp
```

### 6.3 Local Eco-Score Formula

```text
eco_score =
  smoothness_score * 0.40 +
  braking_score    * 0.25 +
  speed_score      * 0.20 +
  cornering_score  * 0.15

smoothness_score = clamp(100 - acceleration_std_dev * 18, 0, 100)
braking_score    = clamp(100 - hard_brakes_per_km * 28, 0, 100)
speed_score      = clamp(100 - speed_variance_ratio * 90, 0, 100)
cornering_score  = clamp(100 - sharp_turns_per_km * 20, 0, 100)
```

Why this works for judging:
- It is transparent and explainable.
- It runs on-device, reducing latency.
- It demonstrates real embedded logic, not just a website simulation.

### 6.4 Telemetry Packet

## 12. What Is Live vs Simulated

Judges value honesty. The final presentation should clearly state:

| Component | Demo Status |
|---|---|
| ESP32 motion detection | Live |
| OLED/LED/buzzer feedback | Live |
| WebSocket dashboard updates | Live |
| Eco-score calculation | Live, locally computed |
| GPS route | Live if signal available, simulated fallback indoors |
| Route energy comparison | Simulated using real formula and route-like sample data |
| Eco-City and forest updates | Live in app based on telemetry/rewards |
| Leaderboard/fleet data | Seeded demo data plus live current user update |
| Future AI coaching | Not built; positioned as future improvement |

---

## 13. Proposal Structure

The PDF proposal should use one cover page plus five content pages:

1. **Cover Page:** Project name, team name, tagline, theme fit.
2. **Page 1:** Problem statement and target users.
3. **Page 2:** Solution overview and product modules.
4. **Page 3:** Technical implementation, architecture diagram, stack.
5. **Page 4:** Expected live demo and hardware plan.
6. **Page 5:** Impact, future improvements, conclusion.

---

## 14. Figma UI Scope

The Figma website demo should include seven desktop pages:

1. Live Drive Dashboard
2. Eco Route Planner
3. CarbonTwin Forest
4. Eco-City Builder
5. Community Challenge
6. Fleet Command Centre
7. Trip Replay & Carbon Certificate

Design direction:
- Professional dashboard, not a marketing landing page.
- Dark cockpit-style surface with clear high-contrast data.
- Green used as a signal, not the whole palette.
- Amber/red warning states for driving behaviour.
- Cyan/blue for route and telemetry.
- Cards with small radii, dense information, and strong hierarchy.
- Components: sidebar, top status bar, metric cards, charts, map panels, event rows, leaderboard rows, building tiles, route comparison cards.

---

## 15. Why This Can Score High

EcoDrive+ is strong because it turns the handbook's expected EV dashboard into a complete sustainability loop:

- Hardware proves the embedded systems requirement.
- C++ firmware proves technical depth.
- Real-time web dashboard proves software execution.
- Carbon calculations prove sustainability relevance.
- Gamification proves creativity.
- Community and fleet views prove impact beyond one driver.
- Clear live vs simulated disclosure builds judge trust.

The project is ambitious, but the demo spine is simple and reliable: move the ESP32, watch the website change, then show how that behaviour becomes measurable carbon impact.
