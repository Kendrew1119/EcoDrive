# EcoDrive+ Champion Build Plan
## Drive Green. Earn Green. Grow Green.

EcoDrive+ is a live EV sustainability platform that turns driving behaviour into visible climate impact. The final demo uses a **two-app architecture** designed specifically for hackathon pitching: an interactive **Driving Simulator** on an iPad feeds real-time input to an **ESP32 hardware brain**, which processes eco-scores and triggers physical feedback (LEDs, buzzer, OLED), then forwards the results to a **Main Dashboard web app** on a laptop screen showing gamification, rewards, and leaderboards.

This plan is built to produce a working demo system for the MBOT Fuel Not Found Hackathon 2026 pitching stage.

---

## 1. Winning Position

Most EV dashboard ideas stop at displaying numbers. EcoDrive+ is designed as a behaviour-change system, and the demo proves the full loop end-to-end:

1. **Drive** using an interactive iPad simulator that feels like an F1 racing game.
2. **Process** the driving input through a real ESP32 microcontroller that calculates eco-scores locally.
3. **Feel** instant physical feedback: green LEDs for smooth driving, red LEDs and buzzer for harsh braking.
4. **See** the results live on the Main Dashboard: eco-score gauge, EcoCoins earned, carbon saved.
5. **Play** by investing EcoCoins into an Eco-City Builder that generates passive Yield Coins.
6. **Redeem** Yield Coins in a Rewards Marketplace for real-life rewards like coffee discounts.
7. **Compete** on a Community Leaderboard that ranks drivers by carbon impact.

The core pitch line:

> EcoDrive+ does not only tell drivers they saved carbon. It lets them see it, feel it, prove it, and build something with it.

## 2. Judging Criteria Strategy

| Criteria | Marks | EcoDrive+ Strategy |
|---|---:|---|
| Problem Definition & Understanding | 15 | Frame the problem as a visibility and behaviour feedback gap in EV usage, not merely a missing dashboard feature. |
| Creativity & Innovation | 20 | Two-app architecture with hardware-in-the-loop: driving simulator feeds ESP32 which feeds dashboard. Plus city-building gamification and real-life rewards. |
| Technical Execution | 25 | Show a working ESP32 receiving live data from a driving simulator, processing eco-scores, driving physical outputs, and streaming results to a dashboard web app — all in real-time. |
| Presentation & Communication | 20 | Two-screen live demo: iPad driving game + laptop dashboard updating simultaneously while ESP32 LEDs and buzzer react on the table. |
| Sustainability & Impact | 20 | Translate every trip into kg CO2 saved, kWh avoided, money saved, and campus-wide reduction potential. |

### 3.2 App 1: Driving Simulator (iPad)

A web app optimised for iPad landscape (like an F1 racing game):

- **Route Selection Screen**: Leaflet/OpenStreetMap showing two routes. Eco-Route highlighted green with EcoCoin bonus. Tap to start driving.
- **Driving Game Screen**: 2D top-down road view with the car moving forward. Two large touch zones at the bottom: gas pedal (right) and brake pedal (left). Speed indicator. The road has curves, traffic lights, and stop zones that test driving smoothness.
- **Data Output**: Every 200ms, sends a JSON packet to the ESP32 over WiFi WebSocket containing throttle position, brake force, current speed, and steering angle.

### 3.3 ESP32 Hardware Unit

The ESP32 acts as the "car brain" sitting on the table during the pitch:

- **Input**: Receives raw driving data from the Simulator App via WiFi WebSocket.
- **Processing**: Computes the eco-score locally using the same formulas as a real EV would. This proves embedded computing capability.
- **Physical Output**:
  - SSD1306 OLED showing live eco-score and event alerts.
  - WS2812B LED strip showing green/yellow/red behaviour feedback.
  - Buzzer for harsh brake or unsafe acceleration warnings.
- **Data Output**: Forwards the processed telemetry (eco-score, coins earned, events, carbon saved) to the Main Dashboard via WiFi WebSocket.

### 3.4 App 2: Main Dashboard (Laptop/Monitor)

A web app running on a laptop or external monitor:

- Live dashboard receiving processed telemetry from ESP32.
- Big eco-score gauge.
- Trip metrics: speed, distance, kWh estimate, CO2 saved, EcoCoins earned.
- Live event feed: acceleration, harsh brake, smooth segment, reward.
- Eco-City Builder (with passive coin yield for real-life rewards).
- Rewards Marketplace for redeeming Yield Coins.
- Community leaderboard and campus challenge.
- Fleet/control-room view for judges to see scalability.

## 6. ESP32 Firmware Plan

### 6.1 Hardware Components

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| ESP32 | Main controller, WiFi WebSocket client/server. |
| SSD1306 OLED | Show live eco-score and event alerts received from processing. |
| WS2812B LED strip | Ambient colour feedback: green, yellow, orange, red based on eco-score. |
| Buzzer | Short warning tones for harsh braking events. |

> **Note**: MPU6050 and GPS are NOT used in the demo. The ESP32 receives driving data from the Simulator App instead of physical sensors. This is intentional — it proves the same processing pipeline works whether data comes from real sensors or a simulator.

### 6.2 C++ Module Design

```text
/firmware
  src/
    main.cpp
    input/SimulatorReceiver.cpp     ← NEW: listens for WebSocket data from iPad
    scoring/EcoScore.cpp            ← Same eco-score logic
    feedback/OledView.cpp           ← Same OLED output
    feedback/LedFeedback.cpp        ← Same LED output
    feedback/BuzzerFeedback.cpp     ← Same buzzer output
    output/TelemetryForwarder.cpp   ← NEW: sends processed data to Dashboard
    network/WifiManager.cpp         ← WiFi connection management
```

### 6.3 Local Eco-Score Formula

```text
eco_score =
  smoothness_score * 0.40 +
  braking_score    * 0.25 +
  speed_score      * 0.20 +
  cornering_score  * 0.15

smoothness_score = clamp(100 - throttle_change_rate * 18, 0, 100)
braking_score    = clamp(100 - harsh_brakes_count * 28, 0, 100)
speed_score      = clamp(100 - speed_variance_ratio * 90, 0, 100)
cornering_score  = clamp(100 - steering_jerk * 20, 0, 100)
```

Why this works for judging:
- It is transparent and explainable.
- It runs on-device, proving real embedded logic.
- The same formula would work with real sensor data in production.

### 6.4 Simulator Input Packet (iPad → ESP32)

```json
{
  "throttle": 0.65,
  "brake": 0.0,
  "speed": 52.3,
  "steering": 0.12,
  "timestamp": 1719648000
}
```

### 6.5 Processed Telemetry Packet (ESP32 → Dashboard)

```json
{
  "deviceId": "ecodrive-demo-01",
  "ecoScore": 84,
  "speedKmh": 52.3,
  "event": "smooth_segment",
  "hardBrakes": 0,
  "coinsEarned": 5,
  "totalCoins": 245,
  "energyKwh": 0.18,
  "co2SavedKg": 0.92,
  "ledState": "green",
  "timestamp": 1719648000
}
```

### 6.6 Hardware Feedback States

| Eco-Score / Event | LED | OLED | Buzzer |
|---|---|---|---|
| 85-100 | Green pulse | "Excellent driving" | Soft success chirp at milestone only |
| 65-84 | Yellow-green | "Good, stay smooth" | None |
| 45-64 | Amber | "Ease acceleration" | Optional short beep |
| Below 45 | Red | "Aggressive driving" | Warning beep |
| Harsh brake | Red flash | "Hard brake detected" | Double beep |
| Coin milestone | Green sparkle | "+ EcoCoins" | Celebration chirp |
